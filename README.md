# go-find
A simplified version of the GNU find utility written in go

## WIP: Usage
The goal of this project is to be able to find the name of a file or folder, if it couldn't find an exact match. It will spit out most similar matches.
```bash
    go-find [file-name]
```
and it will return with the filepath to it like /c/Users/nelwhix/Documents/[file-name]
